/**
 `CPAProxyManager` is a class responsible for coordinating the creation and communication with a Tor client running in a separate thread represented by `CPAThread`. After the Tor client has been started using the `CPAThread` instance, the `CPAProxyManager` uses `CPASocketManager` to send control messages until it has successfully boostraped Tor.
 
 Right after starting Tor, the control message "AUTHENTICATE %control_auth_cookie%" is sent. This uses data from a auth cookie created in Tor's temp directory specified by `CPAConfiguration`.
 
 If the authentication has succeeded, the `CPAProxyManager` starts sending "GETINFO status/bootstrap-phase" messages to poll for the boostrap progress of the Tor client. When the response "BOOTSTRAP PROGRESS=100" has been received, the client is considered to have been successfully setup and the SOCKS proxy is ready to be used.
